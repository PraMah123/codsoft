He rescues Kate Manning ('Barbara Lawrence (I)' (qv)) from being lynched by a mob because she had killed the son of the towns's leading citizen while defending her honor, or what was left of it. Rescuing Kate is an important plot hinge, in a movie that makes little or no sense historically or plot-wise, as her father had ridden with Jesse James. Joe also has an idea that he can learn something by making contact with the Daltons, and his method of doing that is by holding up the train to steal an Army payroll, as he knows the Daltons had intended to steal it themselves and knows they will come looking for him. Being smart enough to beat them to the payroll evidently doesn't equate to being smart enough to know the Daltons are going to be more than a little miffed when they find him.

      "51549 ::: Det gode og det onde (1975) ::: short ::: An extension of The Perfect Human, Good and Evil is a longer, more expansive pseudo-documentary portrayal of life, no less. Using capacious titles or chapter headings that Leth's narrator's voice dwells upon and impresses upon us as he toys with the cliché \"Faces\", \"Bodies\", \"Things\", \"Necessary actions\", \"Unnecessary actions\", Good thoughts\", \"Bad thoughts\", \"Pleasant feelings\", \"Unpleasant feelings\", and \"Words\" - the film consist of aesthetically titillating and contentually almost schematic scenes shot in the void of the film studio: faces, bodies and things. A man with a shoe. Another man with a hardboiled egg which he talks about and eats. A woman gives her husband a shirt. A couple who argue. A desperate woman. And so forth. There is no psychological shading of the characters, merely a series of sketches or examples that are as if plucked out of different everyday contexts. The thread leading back to Life in Denmark is thus also clear. The dialogue is sparse and phrases or fragments of phrases recur, spoken by different actors and in different roles, which may be viewed as an accentuation of the ordinariness of these little utterances and as an awareness of language as such. Besides the professional cast work the film uses several photographic models, the circus artiste Diana Benneweis, and the cyclist ole Ritter, who all pose in front of the camera in small tableaux. In addition to the craziness of the project the film also contains a series of zany comic acts with Claus Nissen to carry them. He bursts into song while washing his hands, dances in an empty room, plays rhythmic games with the statement \"Bossa nova rhythms I have nothing against\" and repeats his mysterious closing line from The Perfect Human: \"Today, too, I had an experience ...\" The framework for the scenes is made up of a couple of visual leitmotifs by way of house fronts and landscapes. In addition a beautiful travelling shot from an avenue at dramatically appropriate moments is accompanied by one of the two tunes by Gunner Mřller Pedersen from the film, sung in a girlish voice by Sanne Salomonsen. In 1999 Lars von Trier chose the film to represent Danish cinema at a number of European film festivals over a period of three years (\"15 x 15: European Cinema Heritage\").\n",

Aristide and his Lavalas political party were democratically elected in 2000 by Haiti's poor majority. The film shows thousands of Aristide supporters gathered to celebrate his inauguration; he promised political and social change, better education, food, and health care for the masses. But not everyone was in favor of change. Haiti's business community and intelligentsia worked against Aristide from the very beginning. And they wouldn't accept, it seems, that a poor man's vote is worth as much as a rich man's. Internationally, most mainstream media reported only negatively on Aristide. At his ouster, they gave the impression that Aristide fled to South Africa out of concern for his safety. A transitional government was put in place as tens of thousands of pro-Aristide people took to the streets to demand his return. Over and over again the film shows marches and rallies of hope-filled people uniting in peaceful protest. Their voices fell on deaf ears. Calling the demonstrators bandits, the Haitian police commit well-documented shootings, arrests and killings.

A former runaway slave who bears telltale scars on his back, he takes Sarny under his wing and, in exchange for a pinch of tobacco, secretly begins to teach her to read and write, a crime punishable by death. \"Words,\" he says, \"are freedom. Slavery is made of words: laws, deeds and passes.\" He starts by drawing letters in the dirt and cautions her that no one must know. At her baptism, Sarny steals a Bible that belongs to Waller's son, Jeffrey, and practices reading by lantern-light in the slave quarters. The same Bible serves another purpose when, on a blank page taken from it, Nightjohn forges a pass for Outlaw, a young slave, to use in escaping to freedom in the North with his beloved Egypt, a slave on another plantation. Waller finds the Bible and demands to know who stole it. Delie, who cared for Sarny as a child, fears for her now and accepts the blame. But Nightjohn forestalls the lashing Delie is to receive, saying he's the one, for he can read. He tries to run away but is caught, and his hand is tied to a chopping block. With an ax, Waller delivers the severing blow, exacting the brutal penalty for Nightjohn's literacy. As he is dragged off to be sold, he tells Sarny, \"When they cut off one hand, the other hand grows stronger.\" That night Sarny writes a pass for Egypt that will let her join Outlaw on the flight to freedom. Two days later their escape is discovered and the false passes found. Waller knows Nightjohn wrote Outlaw's pass. But who wrote the second? He interrupts a church service to demand the answer, threatening to kill all his slaves if no one tells. Sarny confesses, but declares he'll kill no one, for the slaves represent his wealth. As Waller raises his rifle, Sarny implores Callie to speak up for her, hinting that she has read the messages to Dr. Chamberlaine. Callie refuses, but the doctor, fearful Sarny will reveal the relationship, says he's at fault. He tells of teaching Egypt some reading and writing, but now declares it was a mistake. Callie orders that Sarny be sold, and as the girl is joined to a line of other slaves, she asks if any of them have tobacco to trade. What has she to give in return? they want to know. And Sarny draws an A in the dirt.\n",

      "51744 ::: Le Park (2015) ::: documentary ::: A place with nebulous frontiers and laws. Characters captured in an existence whose outlines flee the camera's gaze. Such is the world of the old fairground located in the Arab League Park in Casablanca that Randa Maroufi leads us into. Actions frozen in gestures of exchange, expectation and aggression are played out following a score conducted by the artist who, in the manner of Eric Baudelaire, uses composition to explore reality. But this reality is also virtual, for these scenes come in part from a repertoire of violent self-representations found on the Internet. The artist reprises their vocabulary. Violence, she tells us, is a language, and its interpretation is a matter of context. A strange vitality emanates from the gentle immobility of the silent travelling shot that drifts through the scenes acted out by the local inhabitants, whether simply passing through or precarious residents. Like the roughness of the vegetal and urban architecture of the abandoned park, these existences are not festive, yet they celebrate life's endurance, a vital energy that is hidden yet tenacious. Maroufi's Le Park escapes along each hidden path, leading us on in a gentle dream whose outcome is never revealed to us. Indifferent to our presence, it murmurs its silent rhythm. These scenes, these lives - the artist began by approaching them with restraint, then trust, and always with respect. Without ever seeking to appropriate the indomitable park or the existences that inhabit it, Maroufi leads us into an intimate world on the threshold of an intensity at once real and fantasised. The artist thus draws, incisively yet delicately as if with a metal tip, a forgotten tale at the heart of the city but on the margins of the world.\n",

However, what is increasingly being offered is language immersion programs in public schools, where everything is conducted in that language, except for the separate English class taught in English. These programs are not only populated by students of that ethnic background, but of other ethnicities as well. Durrell, a black child, is starting in Mandarin immersion. Ethnic Anglo Julian has been in Chinese (both Cantonese and Mandarin) immersion for nine years. Hispanic Jason, whose parents don't speak English, is in Spanish immersion. And Chinese Kelly, whose parents don't speak Cantonese, is in Cantonese immersion. Parents are choosing to send their children to language immersion programs so that they may be provided greater opportunities in their future. Some parents, however, fear that English will be compromised in the process, although in reality the exact opposite is true. Some also fear that their child's learning of the second language will be hindered by the parents themselves not knowing the language, or conversely that their own fluency in the language is therefore taking their child's valuable time away from learning English. But being in the United States, many children, unless forced to retain that second language, revert to English for socialization in the English dominated culture. Linguistic activist Dr. Ling-chi Wang has proposed what some consider a radical idea for the San Francisco school district: that all public school students become bilingual. He is hoping that Durrell, Julian, Jason and Kelly will be good examples of what can be accomplished by this proposal.\n",

      "51966 ::: No tan nuestras (2005) ::: documentary ::: The Falklands/Malvinas War has proved a powerful motif in contemporary Argentine film-making and Ramiro Longo's new documentary offers a unique take on the conflict and its pervasive legacy. While Argentina suffered 649 casualties during the War, subsequently over 350 ex-servicemen have committed suicide while attempting to come to terms with civilian life in the aftermath of the 1982 defeat. Longo's film is structured around an extended interview with War veteran Sergio Delgado who provides a moving testimony on the conflict and the ways in which it has subsequently haunted his life and aspirations.

Seton, then 47 years old, was a famous celebrity, the most important wildlife illustrator of his generation, a best selling author, a co-founder of the wildlife conservation movement, co-founder of the world-wide Scouting movement, and a leading figure in the emerging sciences of ecology and ethology. He explored an area unknown to the outside world, documenting its wildlife and determining the geography of a remote lake, Aylmer. I led an expedition to the lake in 2015; its goal was to relocate and document the important places Seton had visited 108 years earlier. The resulting film includes Seton's 1907 photos and drawings supplemented by contemporary still and video images. Most of the film's narration is provided by actors telling the story of the first expedition in the words of Seton and Preble. The narration by Seton and Preble describes the majestic scenery and the wildlife paradise they encountered. While this film is primarily a historic recounting, it does include an environmental message.

Honour killing, one of the oxymoron word. We feel so proud when we hear the word \"Honor\", but Honor killing is a most antithesis act. If a girl is raped, the orthodox families follow the rule of Honor killing; if a woman refuses for an arrange marriage, the family kills the girl in the name of Honor killing. If a woman is raped post marriage, she is refused by the families, when she needs her family the most. Honour killing is like a fame to few men. They feel its a very macho act to kill a woman and protect the respect of their families and caste and villages. But they don't realize that they not only kill the woman but also they are forgiving the rapist and allowing him to repeat his dirty acts. All crimes like gang-rapes, girl molestations, rapes at work, mental harassment are not a matter of short clothes or attractive looking or getting drunk at some random pub, its about the consequences, its about the results after the crime. According to Section 54 of Indian Evidence Act, the victim needs to prove that she is not of an immoral character. The laws are so discriminatory in nature that the victim has to proof her innocence in the eyes of the government, her city, her village, her family. Where is the justice?? Its high time to raise our voices and stand against the culprit. \"Garjana\" Fight Against Rape is an attempt to reach the masses and making them aware of the problems faced by rape victims and laws against rape.\n",

Assigned to gather information on the background of Scanzano, the presidential candidate of Italian origin, he quickly finds out that this politician is a man of unquestion-able integrity. There are no scandals or affairs which can endanger his candidacy. Frank decides to give up his investi-gations, much to the delight of his 18-year-old daughter; Emma believes that her father will have more time for her. Together with the young journalist Carlo, Frank accidentally comes across two puzzling murders. He discovers that both victims had worked as scientists in nuclear power plants from which considerable amounts of highly dangerous enriched plutonium have disappeared. When a third body is found in Rome, however, Frank decides to get to the bottom of things. He therefore pays a visit to one of the dead black sailor's colleagues, who is in hospital in the intensive care unit. But Frank is obviously not the only one who takes an interest in the case. He has just found out that the sailor is dying because he was exposed to an overdose of radioactivity when he witnesses an attempt to kill the man. In the ensuing gunfight, a policeman is shot. Now Roman superintendent Morelli takes charge of the case. Morelli, however, is the one Frank has seen in hospital... Frank is arrested on suspicion of murder. He confides in super-intendent Aquani, who also has his doubts about Morelli. He warns Frank not to interfere with his investigations. But it would take more than a warning to stop Frank, once he has sensed a scoop. The trail leads Frank to a small port where he finds a rusty, inconspicuous freighter loaded with the stolen plutonium. Frank tries to convince Aquani that he has stumbled on a gang of plutonium smugglers. But before the Italian authorities have a chance to stop the freighter, it is already in international waters heading for a small African country - at least that is what Frank has found out. Frank asks Carlo to find out about the owner of the ship and flies to Africa. In the meantime the freighter loaded with the highly dangerous cargo has docked. Together with Limey, an old friend who has been living in Africa for a long time, Frank observes how the deadly cargo is unloaded from the freighter and put onto a truck. Frank drives the truck to a safe hideaway. In the meantime, Carlo has found out that the ship is owned by a Swiss arms dealer called Steuben, who also works with terrorist organizations. In Africa Frank meets an attractive woman. Catherine turns out to be a scientist contracted for Euratom in Brussels. But she does not believe Frank's story; she takes it for journalistic speculation inspired by the wish for a sensational scoop. Two things arouse her suspicion, too. Steuben has flown to Africa in the meantime. On a beach in Lutresh he holds a kind of auction. The Participants: representatives of many different countries. But what is he trying to sell, the plutonium? Frank's hands are the ultimate proof. While having a closer look at the freighter's cargo, Frank's hands were slightly con-taminated. Frank flies back to Rome to track down Steuben, only to walk into a trap. He is charged with rape. Superintendent Aquani has not been idle in the meantime. He can now prove that Morelli is indeed involved in the plutonium smuggling. By arresting Frank he wanted to prevent the journalist from uncovering more and more details. The girl Frank is said to have raped cannot identify him. She turns out to be one of Morelli's marionettes. Aquani is now able to arrest his corrupt colleague. Frank visits Steuben in Paris and tells him that he has found out about his wheelings and dealings. Steuben commits suicide. In his office, Frank discovers a suitcase stuffed with 500,000 dollars and a ticket to New York. He flies to New York, pretends to be Steuben's agent and hands over the suitcase. Never leaving the case out of sight, he observes how the money is delivered to the campaign headquarters of the presidential candidate Scanzano. Frank joins Catherine, who has come to New York in order to report their discoveries to the nuclear lobby of the UN. But before Frank can warn Catherine about the killers of the plutonium mafia, she is murdered. The UNC henchmen don't even shrink from assaulting Frank's family. But Carlo, who has followed Frank to New York, courageously steps in. Suzann and Emma survive the murder attempt. After Frank gets his family into safety, he manages to meet with Scanzano and realizes that the politician is an honorable man who is completely oblivious to the way his campaign is being financed. Scanzano, however, has no choice but to resign. Frank's daughter Emma now hopes that her father will have more time for his family. But Frank already has another explosive story for somewhere in Africa there is an abandoned truck with a dangerous load.\n",

      "52241 ::: The Help (2011) ::: drama ::: Set in Mississippi during the 1960s, Skeeter (Stone) is a southern society girl who returns from college determined to become a writer, but turns her friends' lives -- and a Mississippi town -- upside down when she decides to interview the black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent southern families. Aibileen (Davis), Skeeter's best friend's housekeeper, is the first to open up -- to the dismay of her friends in the tight-knit black community. Despite Skeeter's life-long friendships hanging in the balance, she and Aibileen continue their collaboration and soon more women come forward to tell their stories -- and as it turns out, they have a lot to say. Along the way, unlikely friendships are forged and a new sisterhood emerges, but not before everyone in town has a thing or two to say themselves when they become unwittingly -- and unwillingly -- caught up in the changing times. In Jackson, Mississippi, in the 60's, the aspirant writer Skeeter Phelan has just graduated and returns home after finding a job writing in a futile newspaper column in the local newspaper. When she arrives home, she finds that her nanny and family's maid Constantine Jefferson is gone. Skeeter sees the chance of writing a book about the relationship of the black maids with the Southern society for an editor from New York. First she convinces Aibileen Clark to open her heart to her; then Minny Jackson is unfairly fired by the arrogant Hilly Holbrook, who is a leader in the racist high society, and Minny decides to tell her stories after finding a job with the outcast Celia Foote. Soon eleven other maids accept to be interviewed by Skeeter that also tells the truth about Constantine. When the book \"The Help\" is released, Jackson's high society will never be the same. The time, the early 1960's, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Eugenia Phalen - Skeeter to her friends and family - has just graduated from Ole Miss and has returned home in part to take care of her seriously ill mother. Unlike her female friends and colleagues who used their Ole Miss time solely to find a husband, Skeeter, who has never dated or had a boyfriend despite wanting romance in her life, strives primarily for a career, either as a serious journalist or editorialist. In Skeeter's social circle, the family servants, called \"the help\", are exclusively black. The female servants do the cooking and cleaning, but their primary responsibility is child rearing. The servants get passed down within families from generation to generation, so the child that they raised ultimately becomes the boss. Fifty year old Aibileen Clark is one such servant, who works for Skeeter's easily influenced friend, Elizabeth Leefolt. Skeeter asks Aibileen to help her with her newly acquired job, answering a housekeeping advice column. However, incidents that happen around Skeeter, including her mother seemingly being less than forthright about what happened to their own now absent female servant, the elderly Constantine Jefferson, who raised Skeeter and who Skeeter loved like a mother, make Skeeter come to the decision to write about the experiences of the black female servants in relation to their white bosses. Elaine Stein, a senior editor with Harper & Row in New York, approves the concept, but she knows that Skeeter getting the servants to talk, which Skeeter ultimately discovers is against the law in Mississippi, will be difficult if not impossible. Aibileen, the first and only servant who Skeeter asks, initially refuses Skeeter's request. But incidents around Aibileen ultimately get her and her acerbic-tongued best friend, Minny Jackson, who has long worked for the Walters family and now works for the Walters' racist daughter Hilly Holbrook, to talk to Skeeter on the sly about their experiences. One of those incidents involves Hilly's \"Home Help Sanitation Initiative\", which would ban any black servant from using their white employer's washroom. Minny's experiences also include those with Celia Foote, a young uncultured woman new to the area who has never had servants, who is now married to Hilly's old boyfriend Johnny Foote, and who is shunned by Hilly and her social circle for supposedly cheating with Johnny while he and she were still dating. Even if Harper & Row or any other firm publishes the book, Skeeter and by association any servant who helped her may have a continued rough road ahead in overcoming the resulting wrath, especially by Hilly and her type.\n",

      "52245 ::: We Will Be Remembered for This (2007) ::: documentary ::: It is a film for everyone. It is a clear, rational and non-politicised look at the human issues of Australia's mandatory immigration detention policy. This film poses the essential questions surrounding Australia's refugee policy. Who are the people behind the fences? How did they come to be there? What are the psychological and legal battles they now face? How much do average Australians know about this policy, and if they knew the truth, would they want it to change? To create this film, the film-makers drew together a diverse group of people. A teacher, a nurse, a handful of uni students, travelers and an academic. Some who had never visited detention, others who had done so for years, and one who had experienced it for himself. Those opposed to the policy, those in support, and those as yet undecided. Some who had never really thought about it, another who thought about it for a living, and others in between. The film-makers' objective was almost experimental: to rise above social, cultural and political differences, to draw out common threads upon which all could agree. In other words, this film strips back politics and encourages viewers to see the issue for what it really is: profoundly human. In 2006, a group of young people of different nationalities, backgrounds, attitudes and political views took a trip to the Baxter Detention Centre. The stories of the people they met behind the razor wire surprised, moved and challenged them. 'We Will Be Remembered For This' documents their journey.\n",

The Secretary and the President are old war buddies and the Secretary lost his leg in the war. It is brought to the attention of the Secretary that the President is acting erratically. He is systematically drowning mouse, selecting a new uniform for White House security based on German uniforms, and is obsessing about unfaithful people around him. A union head is murdered when TV is dropped into his bubble bath on orders from the President. A group of hippies raid a National Guard armory looking for weapons. Said group is murdered in their sleep with poison gas including the Secretary's daughter. Her boyfriend turns out to be an US Army Captain acting under orders from the president to set the group up as a false flag. The Secretary agrees to a coup against the President by the cabinet officers. The position of each is decided by a gum ball machine with numbers on each gum ball, number one going to the Oval Office. The Secretary gets number two and the oldest man in the room gets number one. As each person is celebrating the old man seizes up and dies leaving the number one spot to the Secretary. All he has to do now is bring a bomb into the presidential bunker. The day he arrives at the bunker he is very nervous and meets his former friend and President in a bathroom stall. He arrives at the meeting only to find it was all a ploy. The old man is still alive and everyone is in on the joke. The President needed something to convince the American people that he needed real power to save the country. An old friend who tries to get revenge for the death of his radical daughter would be just the ticket. They put his briefcase into a barrel of water only to find... nothing. Just some paper, Rolaids, pencils, Kleenex, and other junk. The Secretary tells off the president and everyone else. As a last gesture he pulls off his artificial leg and slams it upright on the table. As he hops off he tells the assembled conspirators to damn themselves. The secret service assists him to a helicopter outside as the president and cabinet lean forward to look inside the leg. We see the bunker explode with a huge fireball. The pilot asks the secretary where he wants to go. The Secretary says \"The White House\".\n",

It's 1905, and wealthy Londoner, Lord Henry Loam, believes that all men should be treated equally, despite he having a mansion full of subservient staff. Lord Loam decides to host an afternoon tea to where his upper crust family, their equally upper crust friends and his household servants are all invited and are to be treated equally. But because no one else feels the same as him - which includes most specifically his eldest adult daughter, the snobbish Lady Mary, who expects all her manual labor needs to be provided by servants; his head butler, Crichton, who knows his rightful place within the centuries old British class system; and some of the lower staff, such as Cockney Eliza, who doesn't know how to act around \"proper\" people - in combination with another of his daughters, Lady Catherine, being arrested for being a suffragette, the tea is an abject failure. To let the scandal die down, Crichton suggests that Lord Loam and his family take a trip on their yacht. However, in the process, the yacht breaks down in a storm and the family which includes Lord Loam, his three daughters, and two of their beaus are shipwrecked on a deserted island.

If they are ever to be rescued, can their island experience be transferred back to the set British class system? Thinking that the time has come for his family to get away from London and have a bit of a holiday - one of his daughters, a suffragette, has just had and encounter with the police - Lord Loam takes them off on their yacht for a South Seas cruise. Along is Chrichton the family's butler who can seemingly anticipate all of his master's wishes. After a violent storm, they find themselves marooned on a deserted island. Initially, the aristocratic Lord Loam sees himself as being in charge. After two years on the island, the social structure has been upended. Chrichton, the most able at survival in the wilderness, is now the leader of the group and he and Lady Mary, Loam's eldest daughter, are very much in love and about to be married.

Eluding the sheriff and his posse,and posing as an outlaw he joins an outlaw gang and becomes friends with John Durant.

It was almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture camera that the first pornographic films went into production. While those early movies slipped through by masquerading as \"art films,\" the increased censorship of the 1920s meant that these raunchy pictures had to be watched behind closed doors - at brothels, gentlemen's clubs, firehouses, and down in basements. These illegal productions were called stag films, blue movies, or \"smokers.\" Even the processing of these films had to be kept secret, with many of them developed in bathtubs that once were used to make bootleg who had one of these racy shockers in their possession. But if you were caught watching them, you could end up in jail! In this collection you'll see a Park Avenue socialite have an affair with her faithful maid, a tough guy getting a \"delivery\" of \"secret plans\" from a blonde femme fatale, and a case of mistaken identity that works out well for every member of the party involved.

The narrative is split into two parts and point of views; that of the immigration clerks and that of the immigrants. It is a Monday morning. Sarah, Marge and Ashley, the three immigration clerks, prepare themselves for another morning, another week. They have worked with each other for several years and have grown to hate each other. Day after day they wait for the line in front of them to get smaller, but it only gets bigger. The spectator follows their conversation in one continuous shot, going from one officer to the next, with a slow camera movement. The immigrants on the other side of the Plexiglas appear distant, foreign and disruptive, sometimes even arrogant when interrupting the personal conversation among the officers. Finally the camera reaches the last officer, Marge, who serves the first immigrant of the day, Abdul-Mateen, a young Sudanese man. He cautiously walks to the counter and presents his papers to file for refugee status. Marge sees a minor mistake, and recommends that he should come back another day. Abdul-Mateen has heard this before. He becomes furious and hits the counter in front of him with his hand. The second half of the narrative deals with the immigrants. The camera is now hand held, more immediate and the lighting is more comforting. They enter, take a seat and wait. The room fills and little groups form. There are three Indian men, two Russian men, an old Chinese couple, three Nigerian men, a Nigerian woman with her young daughter and a young European girl talking on her phone. Abdul-Mateen and Hasim, his friend, are amongst them. At first the immigrants speak in their own languages or sit silently waiting. Slowly their speech is translated in subtitles and the spectator is invited to identify with them. Although they all come from different parts of the world and different cultures, they share similar concerns. They look at the immigration officers with fear and worry. Finally Abdul-Mateen is called up to the window by Marge. The same dialogue occurs, with Marge denying him refugee status. This time the spectator can see Marge's face, which was not visible in the earlier part, and we realize that she does not even look at Abdul-Mateen, seemingly ignoring him completely. This he has experienced many times before. In front of her Abdul-Mateen is not a person, but a case file, a number. His frustration in the totally impersonal treatment comes out. He hits the counter. The image ends here. Only sound remains and we hear Abdul-Mateen being taken down by a security guard. Hasim joins the fight. There is an obvious struggle. Finally we hear Ashley's voice, as indifferent as always calling for the next immigrant to approach the counter and the routine is about to start again.\n",

With the 17th century Age of Enlightenment, a new way of thinking was dawning. Breakthroughs in science and philosophy led to the search for more humane ways of punishing criminals. Instead of filthy, dank dungeons, prisons were formed to help the prisoner rehabilitate back into society and punishment by execution evolved from the slow strangulation of petty thieves at Tyburn into today's simple pin-prick of the lethal injection. But despite their best attempts, reformers had failed to remove cruel and unusual punishment and torture from society.\n",

This film travels behind the scenes of the world's most prestigious prize and into the minds of two of the people who have reached this pinnacle of excellence. In the most isolated capital city in the world, Perth, Western Australia, two scientists are interrupted while enjoying their fish and chips lunch by a phone call from Stockholm, Sweden. They have just been informed that they have been awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize for Medicine and could they make it to the awards ceremony? Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren journey to the prize-winners' podium is more than just a trip to the opposite side of the world to sub-zero temperatures, cultural pomp and extreme Swedish scheduling-it has been a career of trial and error, endless research and Aussie-battler-style stubborn determination. Today, this odd couple of science travel the globe as heroes-ambassadors of the science world-but it was 23 years ago in a modest hospital laboratory in Perth, that Marshall and Warren discovered a bacterium that survived in the human stomach that they called Helicobacter pylori. They believed that this bacterium, not stress, caused gastritis and peptic stomach ulcers, much to the chagrin of the medical world, which at the time scorned them. After years of careful observation, luck and persistence, they finally had the breakthrough they needed, but not before Marshall infected himself, using his own body as a guinea pig to test their theory. Something that a pathologist noticed as a tiny blue line under a microscope was now a documented new species. The questioning minds of Marshall and Warren have revolutionised the medical community's approach to treatment and dramatically improved the health prospects of millions of people by identifying the real cause of peptic stomach ulcers. This film follows Marshall and Warren's curious and unpretentious lives, capturing their off-beat humour, the people that surround them, struggles, mateship and their paradigm-shifting finding to reveal the profound impact, wonder and excitement of groundbreaking scientific discovery. Through them and other Nobel laureates, we discover what it's really like to win. We also celebrate Australia's proud history of Nobel Prize for Medicine recipients.

A middle-aged widowed eccentric, Beatrice is looking for her life in the classified ads while all about her is the rubble of an unkempt house. All she needs is the right opportunity, she says puffing on a cigarette. Poorly equipped to survive the vagaries of modern life, she has nonetheless always managed to muddle through. Ruth, epileptic and making her way through the rebellious phase of adolescence, seems doomed to make the same mistakes as her mother. Quiet Matilda, on the other hand, seeks refuge in her animals and her schoolwork. \"Jesus, don't you hate the world, Matilda?\" Beatrice asks her youngest daughter. The title of the film is also the subject of Matilda's science project at school and serves as a metaphor for the way life affects each of us differently -- how some are able to find opportunity in adversity and thrive and how some succumb when the burden becomes too heavy. This is the story of slowly drowning and grasping desperately for a lifeline only to find that there's none there and you must save yourself. \"No, Mama,\" Matilda says, \"I don't hate the world.\" (Nell Potts, who stars as Matilda, is the stage name of Eleanor Newman -- Joanne Woodward's real-life daughter. She also appeared as the young Rachel in *Rachel, Rachel*.) Widowed Beatrice Hunsdorfer is miserable in her life, and in turn she has contempt for everyone around her. She blames everyone except herself for her problems, but most specifically her now deceased husband George who left her before he died. People who know her believe she's crazy. She dreams of a better life - mostly by wanting to open a tea room where she would sell what she believes would be her world famous cheesecake - while realistically not being able to achieve that dream as she lounges around her run down and unkempt house smoking, drinking, reading the personal ads in the newspaper, and somewhat taking care of her elderly boarder, which is how she makes ends meet. Her eldest daughter, Ruth Hunsdorfer, knows the reputation her mother has around town. Although she displays some teen-aged bravada, Ruth seems destined to be just like her mother. Beatrice's younger daughter, Matilda 'Tillie' Hunsdorfer, is the quiet, shy but intelligent offspring. Tillie is supported by her teacher, Mr. Goodman, in achieving academic excellence. The dysfunctional family dynamic is placed to the test in the lead up to the school's science fair awards ceremony, where Tillie's project on the effect of gamma rays on man-in-the-moon marigold seeds is one of five shortlisted for the grand prize, the resulting seedlings which seem to mirror the Hunsdorfer family itself.\n",

Meanwhile, Obama is committed to diplomacy with Iran as the path toward nuclear compromise and reconciliation.

By tracing the history of Islam's great conquests and determined struggles against non-believers since the time of the Prophet Muhammad, Director Joel Gilbert illustrates that Islam's values and goals are decidedly different from and mostly incompatible with Western secular society. \"Marg-bar Amreeka (Death to America)!\" Atomic Jihad leaves little doubt that Iran is in the final stages of preparing a Coming War for Islamic Revival. Meanwhile, by seeking to appease Ahmadinejad with \"change\" in U.S. Middle East policy, President Obama is ushering in the Politics of Defeat for America. If successful in its nuclear program, Iran and its allies will finally possess the means to achieve their ultimate goals - the defeat of America and the return of Islam to past glory.\n",

      "52717 ::: A sírásó (2010) ::: short ::: A stranger comes to town in this adaptation Rainer Maria Rilke short story, and gets a job as a gravedigger - and the adoration of the local bigwig's daughter. She spends entire days with him in the cemetery garden, talking about death and dying. A plague befalls the town, sparing only a few, leaving them the task of pushing coffin-laden wagons to the cemetery. The film uses the same camera that records horse racing photo finishes; it does not provide the feeling of space like an ordinary film or photographic camera. Gravedigger lacks the illusion of movement typical of most films. Photographed images track from left to right across the screen. Deformed and fuzzy, as if shot by a trembling hand, the images look like blurred film frames, moving too slowly to create the impression of movement, sometimes forming surreal or abstract compositions. The director takes the audience to pre-Lumičre cinema to experience motion picture construction (panoramas) and narration.\n",

But, I was raised in little Havana, which makes me Cuban-American. However, since I don't see Castro as the root of all evil in the universe, nor would I strangle him with my bare hands given the opportunity, I am a little out of step with my tribe. I always have been. And I really don't care. My dad, on the other hand, does care. He cares a great deal. Back in Havana he was a revolutionary and fought alongside Castro for the freedom of the Cuban people. Then he had a falling out with his old friend and it was Miami, here we come. But his animosity towards Castro did not last and he soon wanted dialogue with the Cuban government. Perhaps, to live in peace. That's when the shit hit the fan. Bombings, death threats and drive by shootings were a daily occurrence in our home. But who would do this to us? We were Americans. Surely, it must be the Communists, right? Wrong. My father became the focal point of the anti-Castro terrorists. These are Americans, people, like you and me. Well, not exactly. They were trained by the CIA. What most Americans don't know is that terrorism in America did not begin on September 11th. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a reign of terror in Miami. There were as many as seven bombings in one day and hundreds per year. The culprits were not Communists. They were Americans. And my family was at the epicenter. Bombs away. *** With a childhood filled with bombings and assassination attempts on her father, the filmmaker explores her relationship with him and the Cuba he left behind. Through the prism of a daughter we explore the past, the present, and the nature of social responsibility and personal sacrifice. The movie contains highly controversial top-secret audiotapes of a CIA trained Cuban exile Terrorist who is in the middle of a trial and incarcerated by Homeland Security.

On September 22, 2003, he was arrested in Katmandu, Nepal, by police who want to charge him with two murders committed twenty six years ago. Charles Sobhraj' recent capture is opening up a Pandora's Box of a man who has been variously labeled as the most evil man of the 20th century, a serial killer, a brilliant disguise artist, a modern Don Juan who uses women to achieve his goals, an escape artist able to break out of a dozen maximum security jails, an existential animal without morality, the ultimate liar and disguise artist of our time. Sobhraj has never been convicted of even one of the alleged fifty murders he was accused of in Thailand, India, Nepal and elsewhere - most of them young backpackers on the dope and Nirvana trail of the seventies. When he was eventually captured in India in the 70s, Sobhraj avoided certain trial and execution in Thailand by contriving to have himself jailed for twenty years in India. In Tihar jail, Delhi, he became its don and patronized and won the friendship of Islamic terrorist leaders who were his jail mates. On his release he sought and was given French nationality as part of a bargain between Indian and French governments. Eventually living in Paris, he turned to arms dealing and through his jail acquaintances began supplying arms to the Taliban and other jehadi groups based in Pakistan. He even boasts of his brokerage of a possible nuclear deal with Iraq. The story of his life as a boy during the Vietnam war, his abandonment by his father, the story of his progress into crime and his trail of serial murders, the twenty years in an Indian jail and his precarious arms-dealing existence after his release make Charles Sobhraj the subject of an extreme drama of our times. Told through the eyes of his victims, a researcher who has spent 30 years on his case, the police who chased him, the women who loved him, his confidants and friends, and last but not least Charles Sobhraj himself, \"Snake\" reconstructs the life and journey of this fascinating and terrifying character.\n",

      "52731 ::: Ghost Town: The Movie (2007) ::: documentary ::: Dean Teaster's GHOST TOWN \"The Movie\", is a unique \"Eastern\" Western. It is N.C. native Dean Teaster's tribute to his father Robert Doyle Teaster and \"Ghost Town In The Sky\" theme park. The theme park was a large piece of the childhood happiness for Dean's family and many families since its opening in 1961. This story combines actual family facts of the Teaster family fictionalized into a story that encompasses the best elements of the staged gunfights performed by the Legendary \"Ghost Town Gunfighters\" throughout the years at the park. Many of the original actors have returned for roles in the film. Former \"Ghost Town Gunfighters\" Robert Bradley once known as \"The Apache Kid,\" Herbert Cowboy Coward \"GrandPappy,\" and Harry Valentine \"The Golden Voice of Ghost Town\" play pivotal roles in the film as does Alaska Presley who was one of the original park founders. Dean Teaster reprises the role of \"Digger\" made famous by his father. This movie was created to offset many of the \"Hillbilly\" stereotypes often depicted with this area. The movie paints a picture of this beautiful mountain region that was settled by the overseas Celtic people. These settlers were full of rich traditions and a true grit that allowed them to survive and thrive during the rugged 1800's period of US History often shown in western films. This movie may well be the birth of a sub genre of the western known as \"The Eastern.\" With a slight romantic edge this movie is chalked full of messages about love, hate, family, forgiveness, redemption and sacrifice. This film builds on a regional theme where conflict was often fought over family honor versus land as often depicted in westerns due to the gold rushes and land acquisitions and expansions. Being a lover of the western genre I think that we have told a story that will entertain many generations of people and with the re-opening of the \"Ghost Town In The Sky\" theme park we look forward to bright future built upon the past.\n",

Giant Hummingbirds and red-backed hawks raise their young in the southern reaches of the Atacama where survival is a constant battle against the extreme natural conditions. From sea level to the seemingly never-ending, interior plains, both flora and fauna display their diversity as they struggle with life's basic needs. Across the enormous expanse of plains, heat mirages create a surreal landscape where survival is limited to the best adapted species. Reptiles such as the Peruvian short-tailed snake and the Chilean iguana can be spotted, hunting amongst the rocks, sand, and cacti that make up this sterile region. Nonetheless, once every decade, life's apparent monotony is transformed by powerful rains. The effects are magical.... here on the edge of survival, life demonstrates its staggering persistence as both predators and prey are quick to take advantage of the resulting fleeting abundance. Meanwhile, other animals appear only after the scarce rains and there is a flurry of activity to ensure future generations. This miracle is crowned by an event admired by all.

But when the show breaks for the night, police arrest him on suspicion of cheating; how could a street kid know so much? Desperate to prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and his brother grew up, of their adventures together on the road, of vicious encounters with local gangs, and of Latika, the girl he loved and lost. Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show's questions. Each chapter of Jamal's increasingly layered story reveals where he learned the answers to the show's seemingly impossible quizzes. But one question remains a mystery: what is this young man with no apparent desire for riches really doing on the game show? When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out. At the heart of its storytelling lies the question of how anyone comes to know the things they know about life and love. Jamal and his brother Salim were raised in the slums of Mumbai. Orphaned at a young age, they managed to survive as did their young friend Latika. Jamal becomes a contestant on India's version of Who Wants To Be A Millionnaire. He manages to get to 10 million rupees in his first appearance but is arrested by the police who want to know how an illiterate 'slumdog' - as children raised in the slum are called - could possibly know all of those answers without cheating. He explains how specific events in his life taught him the answers and all he can say that being asked questions to which he knows the answers is simply fate. He hopes that fate will give at least one more good turn as he had a very specific reason for going on the show in the first place. The quintessence thirst to know and absorb the eesence of love and life, emulates through a story of a slum boy Jamal, participating in a Indian television reality show, Koun Banaga Cororpati. The staggering experience of real life enables him to cross all hardles of answering the questions, but only to be convicted of cheating before the last answering winning streak. The film evokes the climax, regarding how Jamal tackles the final question, to win the show and prove the superiority of one's surreal ability to comply a meandering journey, abiding Nature's pragmatic ethos of life. Eighteen year old Jamal Malik is having an amazing answering streak on _\"Kaun Banega Crorepati?\" (2000)_ (qv), the Indian version of the television game show _\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" (1998)_ (qv). He's only one correct question away from the big prize. However, some, including those associated with the game show, question how someone like Jamal, a self confessed non-genius who grew up in the slums of Mumbai, can be doing so well on the show when others who are brighter, more educated and wealthier than him have failed. Is Jamal cheating? Is it purely luck that they have asked him the questions to which he knows the answers? Seeing Jamal's life journey to this point ultimately answers these questions. His life journey includes being orphaned at an early age; growing up with an older brother, Salim, who was both his guardian/protector and antagonist; and having a relationship since childhood with another orphaned child, a girl named Latika. His motivation for being on the show also may provide some answers to his success. Perhaps it was all just meant to be. In Mumbai, the eighteen year-old orphan from the slums Jamal Malik is tortured by the policemen in a precinct accused of cheating a game show. Jamal, who has no education and works in a call center serving tea, is close to wining twenty million rupees in the show _\"Kaun Banega Crorepati?\" (2000)_ (qv) (Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?) hosted by Prem Kumar, giving precise answers to the questions and raising suspicion of fraud. The police inspector shows the videotape and after each question, Jamal tells parts of his childhood with his brother Salim, his crush for Latika and their fight to survive on the streets to justify each correct answer, guided by his common sense and past experience, and prove his innocence.\n",

Meanwhile, as Masha and Sasha move in, they discover that none of their neighbors have keys, so they all spend an evening of singing and dancing in Masha's and Sasha's apartment.

San Francisco based architect George Smith is dissatisfied with his professional life, especially after his company completes design of a large development project, in which his small contribution - a big, square, empty warehouse - he was not even allowed to include a washroom. As George, a former art school student, is inspired by the works of 'Pablo Picasso (I)' (qv) who looks at the world in his own way, George convinces his wife, Alice Smith, that they expand on what was supposed to be only his one week off following completion of that project by traveling to France for as long as it takes to find Picasso so that they can just say thanks to him for the happiness he has given them. Locating Picasso and actually being able to speak to him may be two totally different matters. Based on advice from Picasso's friend 'Luis Miguel Dominguín' (qv), George goes to extreme lengths to achieve his goal. The larger questions are whether this trip will reinvigorate George's life especially if the Smiths aren't able to meet and speak to Picasso, and what will happen to their marriage, especially as this quest is more George's than Alice's.\n",

From the minute he checks into his hotel with his ancient American Tourister and cummerbund money belt, it's clear Tim has no idea how the modern world really works. He is soon smitten with seductive Nebraskan insurance agent Joan Ostrowski-Fox (Heche) and awed by his experienced roommates, the straight-shooting Ronald Wilkes (Whitlock Jr.) and the suspicious Dean Zeigler (Reilly). Disheartened when he comes face-to-face with corporate corruption, Tim is ultimately lured beyond the lobby into an urban jungle he's only ever seen on DVD and when it seems his life - and chances to succeed - have gone completely topsy-turvy, he finds his own unjaded way to turn it all around. Tim Lippe has led a sheltered life in Brown Valley, Wisconsin, and thus has a simplistic view of the world, he liking the comfort of knowing everyone he comes across in his small town daily life. In his naive view, he believes his once weekly sexual encounters with Macy Vanderhei, who was his seventh grade teacher now recently divorced, is true love on both their sides. He loves his job as an insurance salesman for Brown Star Insurance, owned for twenty-five years by Bill Krogstad. Tim truly tries to do what's best for his clients.

On behalf of Brown Star, those winning presentations have been made by the agency's wunderkind, Roger Lemke, who Tim and everyone else in their office truly admires. Brown Star's winning streak is threatened when just before the upcoming ASMI convention, Roger dies under somewhat shady circumstances. His death not only means that he won't be making the presentation this year, but those shady circumstances, which if they came to ASMI's attention, would taint Brown Star's reputation as ASMI has a strong Christian morality at its core. Bill decides to send Tim to the convention as Brown Star's representative despite Tim feeling non-confident in heading to the big city to fill Roger's big shoes. At the convention, Tim is ill-prepared to deal with the people he meets, from the three conventioneers with who he ultimately hangs - Dean Ziegler, Joan Ostrowski-Fox, and Ronald Wilkes - to Bree, the young woman loitering in the convention hotel parking lot, she who he is naively unaware is a hooker. They are all outside his mentality of that comfortable Brown Valley life.

From the Beatles' \"Strawberry Fields\" to Black Sabbath to Kanye West, Mellodrama is a 50-year odyssey of musical invention, revolution, betrayal, and rediscovery. The Mellotron is a keyboard instrument that plays prerecorded tape loops. It was invented as the Chamberlin organ in Harry Chamberlin's Southern California backyard in the late 1940s. Harry wanted to sell his \"orchestra at your fingertips\" to every Aunt Mable in America, and drove his motor home across America doing so. But his trusted salesman Bill Franson took two instruments to England, and found manufacturers to replicate the Chamberlin. Under this dubious pretense, the Mellotron was born. Soon, through the music of the Beatles, the Zombies, and the Moody Blues, the Mellotron became the \"instant magic sound.\" In the 1970s, the Mellotron defined the sound of progressive rock bands like King Crimson, Roxy Music, and Genesis. Though forgotten during the 1980s, when digital synthesizers hijacked pop music, the Mellotron is today again a highly desired and sought-after device, a connection for artists like Radiohead and Kanye West to the mystical lost world of invention and possibility.\n",

      "53053 ::: Return to Morocco (2015) ::: documentary ::: The first Jews arrived in Morocco 2000 years ago and contributed to Morocco's mosaic society. Jews and Muslims, either from Arab or Berber origin, are generally proud of Morocco's diversity. But around 50 years ago, an irreparable break tore apart Morocco's social fabric. In addition to the sufferings provoked by French colonialism and years of authoritarianism under the former King Hassan II, the foundation of the state of Israel and its need for Jewish immigration had huge consequences on Morocco's Jewish community. The Israeli intelligence infiltrated Morocco to scare Jews into leaving their homeland, arguing that Muslims were a threat for them. Today, Morocco's once thriving Jewish community has only around 2000 members left. Through the lives and testimonies of Fanny, Pinhas, David and Vanessa, we revisit this troubled and often taboo period of history. The characters tell us about why they decided to come back to Morocco, a country that could be an example of religious cohabitation for today's disintegrating Middle East. Fanny once left Casablanca illegally to Israel, and ended up being a human rights activist in France. Pinhas left his Berber village as a child and never really recovered from the separation: wasn't Morocco his true homeland after all? David never left and made a fortune by buying real estate from departing Jews. Vanessa's family left Morocco 200 years ago. Today, she moved from the United States to Casablanca to research and sing traditional Moroccan Jewish music. But life is not always easy for them in Morocco. Indeed, the Arab-Israeli conflict makes it harder for Moroccan Jews to define their place in the Kingdom. However, Muslims and Jews alike are committed to preserve Morocco's Jewish memory, an indelible element of Morocco's society.\n",

The outline of a human figure is briefly visible, though long enough to form a trail for the viewer's gaze, which somewhat unsteadily probes the wavering lump. this trail leads to the inspiration for einar's computer animation: an image of the human body. einar, an ensemble of animation artists, uses live footage of a human body to extract, a single image at a time, the outline of an animated two-dimensional image. The visual grammar of the live footage, i.e. the alteration of the focal length, the camera angle and editing techniques, give the virtual bodies their shape. The bodies are used to translate temporal length into spatial depth. Though the Cartesian conception of the body, according to which it occupies a certain amount of three dimensional space, is applied, this presence is exclusively temporal in timebased_body. In the flow of time, the (two dimensional) contours of the human body fade and take on fascinatingly irritating forms in a fictitious space. (Robert Buchschwenter)\n",

They set off up a narrow mountain track between bushes and boulders. Ropes appear - a safety measure, and shortly thereafter the climb takes them into a dark, narrow and wet tunnel in a cliff. There, feeling their way forward and groaning they go up and down in a never-ending rocky gorge accompanied by the threatening sound of falling stones. It should be said that here the framework and conditions (which are difficult to make out), distort towards the grotesque. After this intended exaggeration they do manage to escape into the open air and events immediately take a conventional turn - the men arrive at a mountain lodge complex where they begin servicing a long-distance telephone box situated there. (Dabernig/Scherer) To some extent Dabernig / Scherer identify with one of their protagonists who, in spite of a physical handicap, does not allow anyone to help him on the steep climb which is, in addition, exceptional and, one could say, strangely old fashioned operation. But, just as this Post Office employee never loses his countenance as chauffeur or later as hiker, the film makers never slip into the trap of simple pleasantries. This is not a visual joke, although it always threatens to tip over and neither is it a culturally pessimistic contribution to current communications and globalisation traps. What is most arresting in Timau, as in the case of Dabernig's Wisla is the art of the moment. Normally the deeply private loneliness of the opening car journey would be at the end of a great melodrama (well, OK it could also be a small melodrama).\n",

      "53280 ::: Living Idle (2017) ::: short ::: Living Idle is a symbolic short film that reflects actions have consequences. This is the story of an artist - a creative sculptor of idols, that puts life and colour into clusters of mud and clay. Ironically, he fails to add colour to his own creation- his world, his family, his child. The narrative revolves around how a creation of the sculptor- an idol of Ma Durga punishes him (by rendering him indisposed and idle), when he crosses all limits of abuse and shows him a life of yearning. The film concludes with a deep dawn of realisation - of how a single action- takes away from him his ability to be a prolific sculptor- that of clay and stone and that of his child's future. The film is embedded with contrasting symbolism, as aptly reflected in its title, most strongly that of the strength of a woman, of a mother, which is - representative in Ma Durga's rendition of 'Good over Evil'. The hunger for food, the hunger for physical fulfillment and the hunger for creativity are natural, necessary and common human instincts. However, an unbalanced, excessive and uncontrolled desire to fulfill one's hunger leads to dire consequences, which is the story of The short 'Living Idle'.\n",

Acknowledging the scientific consensus on the issue, the debate will steer clear of the pointless \"skeptics vs. alarmist\" angle and focus on what we can do as individuals, a nation and a species to avert the impacts of climate change. Attenborough's film lays out seven components of a sane response to global warming - strategies and targets from the household to big industries and government. But each one has implications, and many - like a growing reliance on nuclear power - are highly contentious. Our goal is to debate these strategies in a positive and constructive spirit: combating the paralysis of swirling fears with concrete ideas for informed action.\" But in retrospective, in 2006, Attenborough did not have enough scientific evidence to be more blunt. So, the author of this review simply summarizes the situation of year 2011 as following: Pollution, eating species into extinction and massacre of environment happens on global scale: sacred and very needed by life on Earth trees are being massacred by human predator. Gold mining, illegal tree cutting, illegal ranching in Amazon already destroyed a lot of sacred trees. Films: \"AMAZON with Bruce Perry\", \"The End of the Line (2009)\". Most vicious predator (human) must learn to stop destroying its own environment. Most vicious predator must stop unbounded (exponential) reproduction: it leaves no space for healthy environment for most vicious predator and leaves no space for animals.

      "53503 ::: Aretz Hadasha (1994) ::: drama ::: A brother and sister arrive alone in the new country of Israel after World War II where they hope to find their lost mother. The complexities of life with colorful characters in the refugee transit camp and nearby kibbutz makes it hard to reconcile their real lives with their deeper dream of still finding the Newland. We found this movie lacking any compassion. The characters in it seem to just be wondering around without any purpose - the plot is simply shallow and lacked focus. The two main characters the brother and sister who arrived from Poland are portrayed as very close to each other. However the brother, who is older, ditches his sister for a tempting offer to join the Kibbutz. He returns back to her when the sister puts things back in perspective about their past together. Really? I find it hard to believe that two sibling who are close and survived the Holocaust would so easily part after what they have been through. Sure, he did attempt once to bring his sister on board but when that failed she literally became none existant to him. The movie ends with the brother and sister seeking another new land after they are fed up with their mistreatment. I really liked the flying bear touch who takes them to a new destination (NOT) - Back to Europe perhaps? Most men in this movie are portrayed as irresponsible selfish cheaters. This movie is without doubt biased.\n",

      "53514 ::: To spiti tou Kain (2000) ::: documentary ::: The film's subject is murder; its heroes are seven ordinary men and women who committed such an act. The House of Cain plunges into the people's images, memories, nightmares and reality, as well as their attempts to escape from the borderline situation in which they live. In his own way, each one of the characters -six prison inmates, their guard and one former prisoner- encircle the irrevocable act, which embodies the absurd and crushes their existence. The prison, the morgue, the museum of criminal exhibits, the courts, the police, the ruins of an old penal colony, prison cells yet to be built, the streets in the city - all constitute the mournful route of the perpetrator, the mournful route of the main characters of this film, but also of the still unknown people, who may, at any given time, equally unexpectedly, find themselves in the same position. The events, the intimate details are absent. The House of Cain is a journey in human decline and the guilt that each person experiences in the way and to the degree that he can. The film is a silent lament, humble and awkward for a lost innocence. Whether that can be regained is open to question. It is an exploration of man's limits but also of the boundaries of the documentary genre using the acrobatics of the characters and the acrobatics of style. It is the reality of the soul and the senses as the only cinematic reality and record.\n",

His wife Mary, a former dancer, suffers from chronic clinical depression, exacerbated by family events including her relationship with Jim. Regardless, Jim truly has a protective attitude toward her.

He ran unsuccessfully for governor of Georgia on a segregationist ticket in the 50s. Later that decade, as the head of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, he found himself up against a strong anti-segregation protest movement, emanating from the Atlanta University Center of historically black colleges. After defeating avowed, sometimes violent segregationist, Lester Maddox, in the 1961 mayoral election, Ivan Allen led the desegregation of city government buildings. In his two terms as mayor, Atlanta became the headquarters of the Civil Rights Movement, and the city grew as much as all the previous years since its founding.

His legacy is not that of a hero, but rather that of a flawed person who was willing to lead by compromise.

      "53692 ::: \"The Newlywed Game\" (1977) ::: game-show ::: The basic premise of the perennial game show \"The Newlywed Game\" has been copied and imitated many times, but this original show proved to be the one fans loved (or hated) the most. The rules to this 1970s five-day-a-week syndicated series were identical to those in the classic ABC series. Four couples, each married less than two years, answered a series of questions designed to expose how well the spouses knew (or didn't know) each other. The husbands were first to answer the questions while their wives were secluded offstage; many times, the answers involved \"whoopie\" (a euphemism for \"sex\"). Matching answers were worth 5 points each, while not matching usually led to high-pitched arguments much to the delight of Eubanks and the audience. The process was repeated with the wives answering a series of questions and the husbands taken backstage, correct answers were worth 10 points. A final bonus question (usually general, answered by the wives) was worth 25 points. The couple with the highest point total at the end of the game won a bonus prize \"chosen especially for\" them usually a trip, furniture or mode of transportation (other than a car or truck). Reruns of \"The Newlywed Game\" remains among the highest-rated shows on the Game Show Network. An updated version of the long-running game show, still with veteran host Bob Eubanks. Newlywed husbands and wives would take turns answering (often risque) questions while their spouses were backstage. After answering, the spouses would return and be asked the same questions, earning points if their answers matched their spouse's. The couple that finished with the most points would win a prize.\n",

Or, to phrase it more precisely, a intellectual-existential wank about sex and life - or rather failure in life. An emotionally broken Polish director - the excellent Malga Kubiak, herself an actor-director of sexually graphic movies in real life - gathers a bunch of German wannabe actors in a remote bungalow deep in the forest. The obsessive director, an increasingly tyrannical psycho-maniac, wants total commitment from her actors to her movie, i.e., wants them to have real sex before the camera. She chose German actors because she thought Germans didn't have any problem with nudity. But the cast rebels. They don't mind playing sex, but don't want to do it for real on camera. The director - whose suggestive forlorn beauty is that of a retired porn star - doggedly sticks to her idea, inflexible in her demands. The whole experience turns into a sheer disaster for everyone. A big joke, with hilarious scenes of failed sex that conveys a sense of absurdity close to Gogolian despair.\n",

Randomly drawn, they contain predictions ranging from \"great good luck\" to \"great bad luck\". So the stills from this film - can be pulled randomly in tremendously stretched apparition of happiness and disaster. By tying the omikuji around a tree's branch, good fortune will come true or bad fortune can be averted. By taking this film apart, in slices, it can be perceived as a holy love song, or as a silent preamble of unknown. The luscious colors, bright whites, deep pink skin and emerald greenery feel warm and odd at the same time, familiar and savage. Floating along with the sacred game, viewers are led by an intuitive sense that all this theater and life would mix well, though could both be silly, playful, spooky, and, at times, sinister. \"Omikuji\" begins with an innocent mass-produced object meant to shield and heighten the beauty of the ceremony. All overlooked particles of the game are stitched here together and cast attention upon making diverse new forms of art that crossed boundaries, both culturally and in terms of film-making invasion. Theatrical essence of the ceremony is iconic and obvious, \"presentness is grace\". (Michael Fried's \"Art and Objecthood\"). The film has a bright and dark side to its imagery and music, it feels like devotional scenes of a vaguely secret sect, and clues to the exact meanings of the rituals are hard to find. It acknowledges the offset of winter and the dark, cold, depressing, rainy months that follow.\n",

      "53919 ::: The BQE (2009) ::: documentary ::: Sufjan Stevens is proud to present The BQE, a cinematic suite inspired by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the Hula-Hoop. Commissioned by Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), The BQE was originally performed in the Howard Gilman Opera House in celebration of the 25th anniversary Next Wave Festival in October of 2007. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway is an incidental 12.7 miles of urban roadway built over the course of several decades (1939-1964), spear-headed by the master architect Robert Moses to accommodate for the increase of commercial and commuter traffic in New York City's outer boroughs. The roadway was a painstaking piecemeal project, poorly planned, badly built, and relentlessly encumbered by the obvious obstacles of the era: red tape, neighborhood protests, World War II, and a congested borough whose sequestering layout proved ill-fitting for the automobile. The resulting expressway-a pockmarked, serpentine, congested BQE-has become one of Brooklyn's most notable icons of urban blight. And, for Sufjan Stevens, an object of unmitigated inspiration. The official album release of The BQE follows nearly two years after its original performance at BAM, providing the songwriter (and his various collaborators) ample time to wrestle out all the thematic incarnations of the project, and to attempt an appropriation of Wagner's Gesamtkunstwerk (\"total work\"). The resulting album might be best described as a grand creative franchise-incorporating movie, symphony, comic book, dissertation, photography, graphic design, and a 3-D ViewmasterŽ reel-in which a songwriter's interrogation of one of New York's ugliest landmarks expands athletically to forums and formulas outside of the song itself. In fact, the BQE is everything but a song. First and foremost, The BQE is a self-made home-movie documentation, exhibiting how all the architectural colors of Brooklyn and Queens are fabulously intersected by this ramshackle artery of highway traffic. Shot renegade style on do-it-yourself film cameras, the animated footage of grid-lock crisscrossing the brick and mortar of Brooklyn flickers and cascades Koyaanisqatsi-style on three simultaneous screens. The 16mm cinematography (heroically shot by Reuben Kleiner on a 1960s Bolex) utilizes time-lapse photography, in-camera editing, slow motion, and post-production mirror effects to transform urban blight into a splendor of graphic compositions. The BQE is also accompanied by an idiosyncratic musical soundtrack (composed by Stevens for band and chamber orchestra), evoking a romanticized musical choreography of perpetual motion vs. gridlock. Borrowing variously from Gershwin, Terry Riley, Charles Ives, and Autechre (to name a few), the music showcases skittish woodwinds wrestling out impressionist articulation (in 7/8) and imperial brass anthems evoking various incarnations of the music of the automobile. Further Information: The BQE is available as a double-disc format (CD/DVD), which includes the original 16mm/8mm film (in widescreen \"triptych\" display), the original motion picture soundtrack, a 40-page booklet (with extensive liner notes and photographs), and the stereoscopic image reel\n",
